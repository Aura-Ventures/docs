# Statement of Faith

As a team dedicated to using technology for God’s glory, we affirm the following beliefs, guiding our work in developing resources that help believers grow in faith and connect with the Christian community:

## **The Authority of Scripture**

We believe that the Bible, consisting of the Old and New Testaments, is the inspired, infallible, and authoritative Word of God. It serves as the final standard for all our beliefs, practices, and development efforts. We are committed to ensuring that our content faithfully reflects biblical teaching, providing users with a resource grounded in God’s truth.

## **The Triune God**

We believe in one God, eternally existing in three Persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Our development process reflects this belief by aiming to honor God in every aspect of our work, seeking to use technology as a means to deepen understanding and relationship with Him.

## **Jesus Christ, the Center of Our Message**

We affirm that Jesus Christ is the eternal Son of God, fully divine and fully human. His life, death, and resurrection are the cornerstone of the Christian faith. Our goal is to help users encounter Christ more deeply through our app by providing biblically sound content that points to Him as Savior and Lord.

## **The Role of the Holy Spirit**

We believe that the Holy Spirit regenerates, indwells, and empowers believers. While our app offers tools to aid in understanding Scripture and deepening prayer life, we acknowledge that true spiritual growth is a work of the Holy Spirit, not technology. Our content is designed to be an aid, not a substitute, for the Spirit’s transformative work.

## **Salvation by Grace Through Faith**

We affirm that salvation is a gift from God, given by grace and received through faith in Jesus Christ. As an app development team, our purpose is not to replace the message of the gospel, but to support its proclamation by creating resources that encourage users to engage with Scripture, seek God in prayer, and grow in grace.

## **The Value of Community and Accountability**

We believe in the importance of the local church and Christian community. Our app is designed to connect users not only with personal devotional content but also with tools that encourage fellowship and mutual accountability. We seek to bridge the gap between individual spiritual practice and the shared life of the church.

## **The Use of Technology for God’s Glory**

We recognize that technology is a tool that can be used for good or evil. We are committed to using our skills and resources to glorify God by developing technology that upholds biblical values, aids spiritual growth, and promotes sound doctrine. We strive for excellence and integrity in our work, knowing that everything we create is ultimately for His kingdom.

## **Commitment to Sound Doctrine**

We are committed to theological accuracy in all our content, ensuring that what we present aligns with historic Christian orthodoxy and sound doctrine. Our work is informed by a high view of Scripture and a careful adherence to biblical theology. We regularly review our resources to maintain doctrinal integrity.

## **Humility and Dependence on God**

We acknowledge that our best efforts are still dependent on God’s grace. We approach our work with humility, prayer, and a reliance on His wisdom, recognizing that it is only through His guidance that our efforts can truly bear fruit.

## **Respecting the Limits of Technology**

We believe that technology, while powerful, cannot replace the work of the Holy Spirit, the fellowship of believers, or the authority of Scripture. Our app is a tool to support the Christian journey, but we encourage our users to seek God earnestly in prayer, engage deeply with the Word, and participate actively in a local church.

# Concerning AI + Christian Faith

At Aura Ventures Limited, we adhere to the Westminster Confession of Faith (WCF).  WCF emphasizes the sufficiency, clarity, and authority of Scripture, along with the role of the Holy Spirit in illuminating God’s Word to believers. Here's how we view the topic of AI + Faith.

## **The Sufficiency of Scripture**

The WCF teaches that the Scriptures contain everything necessary for salvation and godly living (WCF 1.6). The use of AI as a tool for Bible study does not necessarily conflict with this doctrine as long as it is seen as a supplement to, rather than a replacement for, the sufficiency of Scripture. AI can help provide historical, cultural, and linguistic insights, but it should not be regarded as adding to or altering the message of the Bible.

## **The Role of the Holy Spirit**

According to the WCF, the Holy Spirit is the one who enables believers to understand and apply Scripture (WCF 1.5). AI lacks the capacity for spiritual discernment and cannot replace the Holy Spirit’s work in illuminating the meaning of God’s Word. AI-generated interpretations or reflections should therefore be used as aids, with the recognition that true spiritual understanding comes from the Spirit.

## **The Clarity of Scripture (Perspicuity)**

The WCF teaches that the central teachings of Scripture are clear and understandable to all who seek them (WCF 1.7). While AI can assist in explaining complex passages or providing background information, it should not suggest that Scripture is inaccessible without technological assistance. The clarity of the Bible remains, regardless of tools used to study it.

## **Guarding Against Doctrinal Error**

The WCF calls for diligent study and careful interpretation of Scripture in accordance with sound doctrine (WCF 1.9). Any AI system used for biblical interpretation should be programmed to align with orthodox Christian doctrine, being cautious not to introduce interpretations that contradict core tenets of the faith. This means ensuring that AI-generated content is continually reviewed by knowledgeable and theologically sound believers.

## **Human Oversight and Accountability**

Using AI in biblical interpretation must involve human oversight. The WCF emphasizes that interpretations should be subject to the wisdom of the broader church and its teachers (WCF 31.3). AI should be seen as a tool that supports, rather than replaces, the role of pastors, teachers, and mature believers in guiding others in the faith.
